# Image Caption Generation using Deep Learning

Week 1 :

Started with learning basic python libraries such as Pandas & Numpy for data analysis
Studied Exploratory Data Analysis by using various types of Graphs and Figures to depict data
Learnt basic Machine Learning prediction techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest ,XGBoost Classifier
Important data pre-processing to deal with Missing values (Imputataion) or Categorical variables (Ordinal / One Hot Encoding)
Assignment task was to predict individual product failures of new codes using various ML algorithms with evaluation based on AUC under ROC curve obtained
Implemented algorithms like XGBoost, KNN Classifier, Decicion Tree, Logistics Regression and Random Forest for predictions along with some data-preprocessing techniques
