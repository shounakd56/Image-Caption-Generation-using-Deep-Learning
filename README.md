# Image Caption Generation using Deep Learning

The goal of this project is to utilize Deep Learning techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. In order to achieve better results, the final model employs a combination of the VGG19 architecture, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. This fusion enables the model to leverage the powerful visual features extracted by VGG19 and generate coherent and contextually relevant captions using the LSTM and NLP components.

Week 1 :

• Studied Exploratory Data Analysis by using various types of Graphs and Figures to depict data

• Learnt  Machine Learning prediction techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest ,XGBoost Classifier

• Implemented data pre-processing to deal with Missing values (Imputation) or Categorical variables (Ordinal / One Hot Encoding)

• The assignment task was to predict individual product failures of new codes using various ML algorithms with evaluation based on AUC under the ROC curve obtained

• Implemented algorithms like XGBoost, KNN Classifier, Decicion Tree, Logistics Regression and Random Forest for predictions along with some data-preprocessing 
  techniques
